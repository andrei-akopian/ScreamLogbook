# Browsh

[Browsh Offical Website](https://www.brow.sh/) and [Browsh Github repository](https://github.com/browsh-org/browsh), also [Browsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browsh)

As of writting, browsh is version 1.8.3. (`browsh --version`)

Browsh is actually fairly well documented. See `SETUP_DEV_[Platform].md` for compilation instructions.x

To Quit Browsh: `Ctrl+Q`

Context on innerworkings: Browsh has Firefox running in the background, and mirrors it into ANSI text on the terminal. It thus requires Firefox installed, and relies on it. In fact, you can view the mirrored instance using `browsh --firefox.with-gui`.
